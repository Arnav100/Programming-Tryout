# Programming-Tryout
  
  I want to be a part of Team 4930â€™s programming sub-team because I have always been interested in programming. Since my previous school did not have any sort of robotics team, last year, a group of my friends and I started our own FLL Team. We did not have anyone who had any experience with the competition, or robots in general, to help us. So own our own we built a lego robot and programmed it, it was difficult but we all enjoyed doing it. We did very well for our first time. That experience made me want to do more, especially in the programming aspect because I enjoyed being able to tell the robot exactly what to do and how to do it. I was very happy when I found out that Nichols had a FRC team, because I knew having proper mentors would be a big help in learning more programming. Since all I have learned about programming is from Codeacademy and Google, I knew that being on a proper team would increase my knowledge in robot code. Helping out during the off season and going to Ruckus was very fun, and I hope to continue coding and going to competitions.
